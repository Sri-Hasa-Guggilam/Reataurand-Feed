# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## To download Scratch project

github link: <https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git>

## How to run the Project

Extract the zip folder that have been submitted .Later ,open the project folder and click     on index.html file and test whether all functionalities related to this project working or not

## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development." This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!

## What will I learn?

You will learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## How will this help my career?

Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.

Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.

## What I have don in this project

-   Initially I have extracted the scratch project from the given github url
-   Later ,I have written few test cases to check whether the project specifications met or not
-   And test case I have written is to know urls are defined are also not empty.
-   Next, I have tested to know names are defined or not
-   Next test case is to check menu element is hidden by default and also we have to check
    menu changes visibility when the menu is clicked
-   Later, I have checked that if initial entries has more than o Entries
    then I have checked for define the new feed is different from old one or not
